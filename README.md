# WebDev-Crafting with Vanilla JS

Welcome to my Webcrafting Repository with Vanilla JavaScript! This repository is a collection of fun projects I’ve developed to explore and learn JavaScript fundamentals in a more engaging and practical way.

Through this personal challenge, I aim to enhance my JavaScript skills by diving into a diverse range of projects, each showcasing different functionalities and applications.

Feel free to explore the project folders to see each application in action. If you find anything intriguing or have suggestions for improvement, don’t hesitate to reach out or contribute!
